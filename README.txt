README

The test suite has its own Runner - AllTestsRunner.java
This file will run the AllTests class, which is the test suite that holds all the JUnit 4 test files
This includes cardTest, deckTest, and playerTest

Running this file should return the output 'true' if all the tests work properly

All JUnit 4 testing has been done using Visual Studio Code, with all testing working properly at the time of uploading
